# JavaScript Basics

This directory consists of very easy JavaScript exercises, mainly to get used to syntax.

Start with the directories and file names in ascending order and just follow the instructions.

Execute a script with Node: `node 01-syntax-error.js` or use your IDE functionality

## PRO TIP:

If you struggle with an exercise for more than 10 minutes - go to the next one and come back later.
